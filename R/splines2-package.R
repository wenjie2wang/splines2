##' splines2: Regression Spline Functions and Classes
##'
##' A supplementary package on splines providing functions constructing
##' B-splines, integral of B-splines, monotone splines (M-splines) and its
##' integral (I-splines), convex splines (C-splines), and their derivatives of
##' given order. Piecewise constant basis is allowed for B-spline and M-spline
##' basis.
##'
##' It is named after the package \pkg{splines}: ``Regression Spline Functions
##' and Classes''. The tailing number two is simply ``too'' (and by no means for
##' the generation two).

In this package vignette, we introduce how to use the C++ header-only library
that **splines2** contains with the **Rcpp** package [@eddelbuettel2013springer]
for constructing spline basis.  The introduction is intended for package
developers who would like to use **splines2** package at C++ level.

## Header File and Name Space

Different with the procedure based functions at R level, **splines2** provides
several spline classes in its C++ interface for ease of usage and maintenance.
The implementations use the **Armadillo** [@sanderson2016armadillo] library with
help of **RcppArmadillo** [@eddelbuettel2014csda] and require C++11.  We may
include the header file named `splines2Armadillo.h` to get the access to all the
classes and implementations in the name space `splines2`.

```C++
#include <RcppArmadillo.h>
// [[Rcpp::plugins(cpp11)]]

// include header file from splines2 package
#include <splines2Armadillo.h>

// for ease of demonstration
using arma
using splines2
```

## B-splines

The `BSpline` class is for creating B-spline basis.

### Constructors

There are mainly three constructors in addition to the default constructor:
`BSpline()`.

The first non-default constructor is called when internal knots are explicitly
specified.

```C++
// 1. specified internal_knots
BSpline(const vec& x,
        const vec& internal_knots,
        const unsigned int degree = 3,
        const vec& boundary_knots = vec())
```

The second non-default constructor is called when an unsigned integer
representing the degree of freedom of the *complete spline basis* (different
with `df` in the R interface) is specified. Then the number of internal knots is
computed as `spline_df - degree - 1` and the placement of internal knots uses
quantiles of specified `x`.

```C++
// 2. specified spline degree of freedom (df)
BSpline(const vec& x,
        const unsigned int spline_df,
        const unsigned int degree = 3,
        const vec& boundary_knots = vec())
```

The third non-default constructor is explicit and takes a pointer to a base
class object.  It can be useful when we want to create a new object using the
same specification (degree, internal_knots, boundary_knots, etc.) of an existing
object.

```C++
// 3. create a new object from a base class pointer
BSpline(const SplineBase* pSplineBase)
```

### Function Members

The main methods are

- `basis()` for spline basis matrix
- `derivative()` for derivatives of spline bases
- `integral()` for integrals of spline bases

The specific function signatures are as follows:

```C++
mat basis(const bool complete_basis = true)
mat derivative(const unsigned int derivs = 1,
               const bool complete_basis = true)
mat integral(const bool complete_basis = true)
```

In addition, we may set and get the spline specifications through the following
*setter* and *getter* functions, respectively.

```C++
// setter functions
set_x(const vec&)
set_x(const double)
set_internal_knots(const vec&)
set_boundary_knots(const vec&)
set_degree(const unsigned int)
set_order(const unsigned int)

// getter functions
get_x()
get_internal_knots()
get_boundary_knots()
get_degree()
get_order()
get_spline_df()
```

The *setter* function returns a pointer to the current object so that the
specification can be chained for convenience.  For example,

```C++
vec x { arma::regspace(0, 0.1, 1) }; // 0, 0.1, ..., 1
BSpline obj { x, 5 };                // degree = 3 dy default
// change degree to 2 and get basis
mat basis_mat { obj.set_degree(2)->basis() };
```

## M-splines, I-splines, and C-splines

The class `MSpline` for M-splines, `ISpline` for I-splines, and `CSpline` for
C-splines have the exactly same constructors and function members with `BSpline`
except there is no publicly available `integral()` method for `CSpline`.


## Generalized Bernstein Polynomials

The `BernsteinPoly` class is implemented for the generalized Bernstein
polynomials.


### Constructors

The main non-default constructor is as follows:

```C++
BernsteinPoly(const vec& x,
              const unsigned int degree,
              const vec& boundary_knots = vec())
```

### Function Members

Same with `BSpline`, the main methods are

- `basis()` for basis matrix
- `derivative()` for derivatives of bases
- `integral()` for integrals of bases

The specific function signatures are as follows:

```C++
mat basis(const bool complete_basis = true)
mat derivative(const unsigned int derivs = 1,
               const bool complete_basis = true)
mat integral(const bool complete_basis = true)
```

In addition, we may similarly set and get the specifications through the
following *setter* and *getter* functions, respectively.

```C++
// setter functions
set_x(const vec&)
set_x(const double)
set_degree(const unsigned int)
set_order(const unsigned int)
set_boundary(const vec&)

// getter functions
get_x()
get_degree()
get_order()
get_boundary()
```

The *setter* function also returns a pointer to the current object.

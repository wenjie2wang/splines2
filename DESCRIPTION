Description: Constructs basis functions of B-splines, M-splines,
    I-splines, convex splines (C-splines), periodic splines,
    natural cubic splines, generalized Bernstein polynomials,
    their derivatives, and integrals (except C-splines)
    by closed-form recursive formulas.
    It also contains a C++ head-only library integrated with Rcpp.

Description: Constructs basis matrix of B-splines, M-splines
    I-splines, convex splines (C-splines), periodic M-splines,
    natural cubic splines, generalized Bernstein polynomials,
    and their integrals (except C-splines) and derivatives
    of given order by close-form recursive formulas.
    It also contains a C++ head-only library integrated with Rcpp.
